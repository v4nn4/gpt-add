## The Problem

We are given a text dataset representing a series of equations in the form `x + y = z`, where `x` and `y` are three-digit integers. The dataset consists of 1 million unique equations, each represented with leading zeroes to maintain consistent positional encoding and simplify batching.

Sample dataset:

```
452+790=1242;720+643=1363;350+471=0821;83
3+734=1567;495+622=1117;137+843=0980;658+
904=1562;223+969=1192;745+505=1250;666+20
...
```

We use the GPT model from nanoGPT. The model is trained to predict the next token by minimizing the loss across all batches.
